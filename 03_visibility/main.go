package _3_visibility

//import "fmt"
//import "package_name"

func main(){

//		fmt.Println(package_name.Variable)			since the first letter of the var is uppercase I can call it
//		package_name.PrintVar()						from the package "package_name" run function "PrintVar()"
}

// Declaring a var at a package level scope allow us to use it just by calling its package in the "import" section at the top of the code
